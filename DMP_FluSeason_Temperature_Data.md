# Data

Currently there are 2 main data sets to be used: the number of hospitalization due to flu and pneumonia and the daily tempeture in Arizona. 

The data for the hospitalization dates from 2012 to 2018 (Ending early february). In that file the data describes is distributed my week and clasified by age and cumulative rate. As for the daily temperature (it also dates from 2012 to 2018) it contains the average if the highest and lowest temparature (Fahrenheit), humidity(%), sea level pressure(inches), visibility(miles), wind(mph), precipitation(inches) and the event that occurred that day(rain, thunderstorm, etc).

# Source of the data
 
The flu data was obtain from the Central for Disease Control and Prevention website. They currently monitor weekly the number of reported cases, the mortality, hospitalization etc for the flu season. As well as interactive maps and graphs of the US and the data for each state. The temperature data was collected from a website called Weather Underground, where you can look at daily, monthly and year-round data of every major airport in the world. 

# Storage and Managament of the data

The flu data comes in various formats( csv, excel, pdf, etc) and retriving it is simple. However for the weather data, there is a bit more work. First it only gives you the history of the temperature per year, and I will be using 6 years of data, meaning I have to make 6 searches. The data is raw so I have to either script it using a code (Python, R, etc) or simply copy and paste it to a word processor and work from there. 

# Analyzing the data (Still no ideal plan)

As custom, we analyze the data to see patterns, distributions anomalies. Since it is a prospectus there is no final decision on how profund the analysis will be. However the standard regression analysis will be performed(individually on the data sets) correlation between variables and factors, distributions and possible trends. 

# Preservation of data and access

Once the project is finished, the data will be added for reference on GitHub and/or the journal it is submitted (if I can be published).
